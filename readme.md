## Self Health 2020

Finding the right health services can be a challenge in normal circumstances.  If the service is displayed, written or visually, in a language that is not native to the viewer, the problem is further exasperated. 

Self Health 2020 aims to deliver an easy interface for users to find the nearest health service.  For each search, data will be collected to identify demand.  This information will be gathered to help health service providers identify new locations to establish services that is in need.
